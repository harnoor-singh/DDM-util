Tasks

-> Have a license, and give credit to Mathieu

-> Write some code for biexponential scripts too

-> Document installation of code, python, libraries, and all current python and library versions

-> Document running code

-> Order of main script (Pseudocode)
	
	DDM3.py
	graphing.py
	curvefit.py
	selectpoints.py

-> Write a separate main script for analyzing rectangular images
	
	cropping.py
	DDM3.py
	graphing.py
	curvefit.py
	selectpoints.py

-> Write about possible optimizations (for future projects)
	- A lot of possible optimizations open up once you can fully understand DDM code 
		(refer to JPEG compression)
	- Maybe you can limit to size of data-points 
		(like using float32 instead of float64). This can be done using NumPy
	- Maybe preprocessing images using convolution or pooling 
		(but this will surely lead to loss of some data. Only do this if you understand the risks and benefits)
	- Using paralled computing / multithreading
	- Maybe do the DDM analysis in C++
